# MDS and K-Means
Portfolio 3 in FYS-2021 Machine Learning at UiT, The Arctic University.
Just some small basic scripts for dimensionality reduction and K-means.

Task 1 does Multi Dimensional Scaling(MDS).

Task 2 does K-means.

The scripts where used to writing a report and not intended for stand-alone use. As the report was written in Norwegian prints for output are written in Norwegian.
